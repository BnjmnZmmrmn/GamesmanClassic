1. When you change the rules in XDodgem, the text doesnt change

1. When you click on it, from the Gamesman console, it doesn't start-up.  The
Error is:
intrepid% Error in startup script: couldn't load file "./../lib/libmcon.so": ld.so.1: /usr/sww/bin/wish: fatal: relocation error: file ./../lib/libmcon.so: symbol __gxx_personality_v0: referenced symbol not found

1. When you click new game, the dots to show you the moves don't show up, but
after you make the first move (the boxes are still highlighted in black, even
though the colored dot doesn't appear) then the dots appear again.

2. If you click new-game in the middle of a game, then the colored dots from
the previous game are still on the board, and the boxes still highlight in
black, but you can't move there of course.  But it goes away after after
you've played a bit.  Probably some simple binding error.

3.  If you click to wildly or fast, then some weird things happen, but I
haven't been able to reproduce the bugs I've seen by this method.

4. sometimes I get this error, but I can't figure out why, it seems to happen
	randomly:

can't read "gSlotList(0,4)": no such element in array
can't read "gSlotList(0,4)": no such element in array
    while executing
"set theSlot $gSlotList($slotX,$slotY)"
    (procedure "HandleMove" line 13)
    invoked from within
"HandleMove [SinglePieceRemovalCoupleMove [expr 45/$gSlotSize] [expr 240/$gSlotSize]] "
    (command bound to event)

1.  It's unclear what is a win and what isn't a win.
2.  No problems, works good.

Dots and Boxes:
---------------
1. When you are about to win, the value moves tell you that your remaining
moves are losing moves, however, they are not losing, they should be green.
2. Sometimes, when you make boxes right away, some of the bars show up, but 
noone has moved there.  Er, what I mean is, some of the lines show up that
haven't actaully been placed, and this happens when value moves are selected.

3.  The computer plays very poorly, it doesn't make boxes when it should.
4.  It won't solve for 3x3, it basically freezes up the computer, and never
gets anywhere, even after waiting forlike 5 minutes.


Chung Toi:

0. I can never figure these games out, we NEED a better rules section that
describes how to play.
1, hitting "new Game" in Chung Toi doesn't bring up moves that you can do.
Also, when you hit "new game" in the middle of a game, it only shows the moves
that were avaiable at the time you hit "new game" (I guess these are the same
thing).

2. Board is too big.  It makes playing new games difficult, becase I need to 
move the window everytime to abort the game and play a new one.

3. When you change the options, it ends the game in correctly.  I had no
rotation in place and no rotation on landing, and the game was ending even 
though the computer had some moves.

4. When you set rotation on landing to no, it still allows you to do rotation
on landing.

5. For some moves, the color of my piece changes from blue to red, and my
moves are incorrect.

  
Foxes and Geese:

1. Errors occur when you change the initial position and you try to solve.
It infinite loops and tons of errors print on the terminal.
