THANKS FOR READING THE README

These steps are all you need to take to run the new gamesman3.tcl.
To get started, copy the .tcl files into the gamesman/tcl directory, and copy the "X files" to the gamesman/bin directory.
Now, you have to run Xmttt3 directly, the tic tac toe built into gamesman will still be the old version.

In other words try out Xmttt3 like this
./Xmttt3

To get started:

1) rename the file Xblank XmYOUR_GAME_NAME (YOUR_GAME_NAME should become the abbreviation you used in your .c file, like ttt or sim.  Note I omit the m.)

2) Inside the file XmYOUR_GAME_NAME, replace the string YOUR_GAME_NAME with the same abbreviation.

3) Rename the mblank.tcl file mYOUR_GAME_NAME.tcl

4) Then you're ready to code, fill in the functions inside mYOUR_GAME_NAME.tcl.

You can run it just like Xmttt
./XmYOUR_GAME_NAME
