THANKS FOR READING THE README

These are all you need to run the new gamesman.tcl.
To get started, copy the .tcl files into the gamesman/tcl directory, and copy the "X files" to the gamesman/bin directory.
Now, you have to run Xmttt3 directly, the tic tac toe built into gamesan will still be the old version.

In other rwords try out Xmttt3 like this
./Xmttt3

To get started:

1) rename the file Xblank XmYOUR_GAME_NAME
(YOUR_GAME_NAME should become the abreviation you used in your .c file, like ttt or sim.  Note I omit the m.)

2) Inside the file XmYOUR_GAME_NAME, replace the string YOUR_GAME_NAME with the same abreviation.

3) Rename the mblank.tcl file mYOUR_GAME_NAME.tcl

Then you're ready to code, fill in the functions inside mYOUR_GAME_NAME.tcl.

You can run it just like Xmttt
./XmYOUR_GAME_NAME
