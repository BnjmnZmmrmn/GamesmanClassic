[Rules]
Rules:

The playing pieces consist of Xs and Os that are colored black or white. On the first move, the first player places his X on the board, with either the white or black side up. Play then continues with two types of moves. The second player moves one of the opponent's pieces to an adjacent open slot by 'flipping' the piece. This will change the position of the piece as well as the color. The player then places his second piece in any vacant square, whichever color facing up. The play then goes to the first player who has the same options of moves as the second player. The players continue until one person has 3 pieces in a row of the same color (black or white).

Note: the game can be modified so that you need a different amount in a row to win.

To move: On your turn, either flip an opponent's piece to an adjacent space or place a black or white piece in an empty space.

To win: Complete a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line with three of your pieces. The pieces must be of the same background color and cannot be broken by your opponent on his turn.

To win misere: Force your opponent into getting three in a row at the end of the game.

Variants: Two in a row
