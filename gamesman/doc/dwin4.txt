[Description]
	Four-In-A-Row has its roots in Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple three in a row pencil and paper game. The object of the game is to get four pieces in a row. Four-In-A-Row, also, adds the element of restricted placement by requiring the players to 'drop' the pieces vertically down the board. In America, this game was popularized under the name Connect Four.
