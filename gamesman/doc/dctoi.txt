	Chung-toi was created by Reginald Chung and is based off of tic-tac-toe.

[Rules]
Rules:

The players begin by taking turns placing their game pieces on the board until all the pieces are played. If neither player succeeds in getting three pieces in a row then the players continue by taking turns moving their pieces to other open spaces on the board. A piece can be moved to any open space as long as an arrow on that piece points in the direction of the desired space. A player may also change the direction of the arrows while moving. Additionally, a piece can just rotate in place or 'pass' (by spinning back to the original position). For a more detailed explanation of the rules, refer to Farzad Eskafi and Erwin Vedar's webpage.

To move: Chung-toi has two phases of moves. In the first phase, each player alternates turns placing three pieces on the board. In the second phase, the pieces may be moved to different slots, rotated or both.

To win: To get three in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

To win misere: To force your opponent into getting three in a row. Variants: rotating piece, turn off one space hops, turn off two space hops, landing in different orientations, and trapped is a win/lose option.
