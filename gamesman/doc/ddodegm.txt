[Description]
	Dodgem was created in 1972 by Colin Vout, then a mathematics student at the University of Cambridge. The original game was devised with two red cars and two blue cars on a 3x3 board. Players alternate turns moving their cars, with the red player moving either North, East or South, and the red player moving either North, East or West.

[Rules]
Rules:

The pieces on the NxN Dodgem board are arranged at a right angle. Players alternate turns moving their pieces to an adjacent open space. The player with pieces lined up vertically may move to the north, east or south, while the player with pieces lined up horizontally may move north, east or west. Pieces lined up vertically leave the board by moving onto the right edge and pieces lined up horizontally move off the board when they reach the top row.

To move: Move your piece into an opened space.

To win: To be the first person to move all your pieces off the board.

To win misere: To force your opponent into moving his pieces off the board.
