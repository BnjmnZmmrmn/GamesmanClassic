[Description]
	Tic-tac-toe, also know as Naughts and Crosses, is one of the most widely known games. Found everywhere from the temples of ancient Egypt to the medieval cathedrals of England, tic-tac-toe has entertained people for centuries. While tic-tac-toe is now considered to be a child's game, it was not always the case. In the past, the game was linked to pagan rituals and was occasionally banned. Recent fame for tic-tac-toe came during a sequence in the Hollywood film Wargames, where tic-tac-toe was used to teach a super-computer about no-win situations.
