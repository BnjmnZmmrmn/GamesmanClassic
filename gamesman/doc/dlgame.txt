[Description]
	L Games humble beginnings started during a dinner conversation between   Edward de Bono and mathematician Professor Littlewood. Both agreed that, while chess was difficult, it was also very complex because of its many pieces. De Bono took up the challenge to create a game that required skill, yet was also simple to play. The result was L Game.

[Rules]
Rules:

The game is played on a 4 x 4 board with the two L-shaped pieces covering four squares. Each player takes turns placing his piece on the board in a different position as that prior to his turn. At the end of the turn, the player has the option to place the neutral circle piece on any open square. The game continues until one player cannot legally place his L-shaped piece on the board.

To move: First select the L that represents the position you want for the L piece. Next, you may move a neutral piece onto the board.

To win: To maneuver the opponent into a position where he cannot move his L piece.

To win misere: To be unable to move your L piece.
