Before autodetection of python is added to the makefiles, you must follow the following:
make
make pygamesman

To play mpyckle:
./mpyckle.py

Support is provided for JIT compiling if you have installed psyco.
The makefile looks for python includes in /usr/include/python2.3 which is very ugly.
If anyone has autotools knowledge, help out.
