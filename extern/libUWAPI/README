libUWAPI

**PLEASE MAKE CHANGES UPSTREAM IN THE GAMESCRAFTERS UNIVERSAL WEB API PROJECT**

This directory contains only the board string formatting code vendored from
GamesCrafters Universal Web API, since the rest of the libUWAPI is somewhat
irrelevant for GamesmanClassic.

The Makefile.in is then customized to integrate with building GamesmanClassic.

After copying the libUWAPI header and source files to this directory, check
Makefile.in so that all files are included. Reconfigure and build the
GamesmanClassic project, and everything should work.

A justification for not using a git submodule in this case is that it's easier
to onboard new developers for the project and libUWAPI should change rarely.
